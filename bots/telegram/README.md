# Telegram Bot

This folder includes the Telegram specific implementation (currently only a small premature example).
The `TelegramBot` handles the interaction with Telegram users/chats and lets them subscribe to channels and receive messages.

It also includes the possibility for admins to send notifications to certain channels by sending `send <message>` to the bot and selecting the channels to which this message should be send.
